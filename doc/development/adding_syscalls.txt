Adding System calls
===================

1. Add system call description to kernel/syscall/syscalls.master

        The format is outlined in the syscalls.master file.

2. Add system call method prototype to include/sys/syscall_constants.h

        The expected name is sys_{name} with return type 'int'. For
        calls that do not return (e.g. exit), prepend the prototype
        with __attribute__((noreturn)).

3. Implement the system call in a .c fle in kernel/syscall/

        The preferred name for a system call's impl file is
        sys_{name}.c. For groups of system calls which share some
        implementation features, it is acceptable to use a single .c
        file to hold each of the implementations.

4. Ensure that the scripts/gen_syscalls.py script is run

        This step will happen automatically iff a clean build is done.
        Otherwise it's your responsibility to do when a new system call
        has been introduced.
